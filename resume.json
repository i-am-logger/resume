In that time Ido worked across many areas of the jet.com tech stack and wore many hats. He built and, in many ways, introduced Micro Services in F# to Jet, he built parts of the core eCommerce platform, he worked on developer productivity tooling among many other areas. At the time, when Jet started, many things did not exist to support a large-scale cloud deployment and Ido was not afraid to jump in and build large scale systems such as our Micro Service orchestration tool, Torch, from the ground up. These early tools and libraries would prove incredibly valuable as Jet continued to grow and scale. It is not a stretch for me to say that I have not worked with anyone like Ido in the past that possess this level of expertise with such a wide breadth of technologies. Ido also made some incredibly valuable contributions to my career early on by sitting down with me and teaching me F# and helping me get acquainted with the state-of-the-art platform Jet was building for eCommerce. This all speaks volumes to Ido’s leadership abilities to mentor and help others grow."

He drove the architecture of the very successful ecommerce platform that we built at Jet.com, especially in the event driven nature of how it was architected.  Ido's deep technical understanding of distributed systems, CAP theorem and related topics meant that he was ideal in thinking through how we implemented comprehensive geo redundancy in the platform.   Additionally, Ido always brought a unique perspective to problem solving and was seen as a thought leader within the group.  He manages to combine theory with practical execution to quickly bring technically sound solutions to life."

It was clear that Ido took the lead on that project and the team produced a high quality product. Later I worked side-by-side with Ido on the development team. In that time he was a mentor: I learned more about software architecture in my two months working with Ido than at any other time in my schooling or career. We constantly challenged each other to write better software. As a team member, Ido makes everyone around him a better developer."

He also is a great team player, willing to help out with any task necessary to achieve and maintain team velocity. There must have been a number of occasions where he has been pivotal in achieving sprint goals and hitting product deadlines.

As such, I found him to be someone who I could discuss many technical issues with and the dialog would produce great results. Ido also keeps up with all the latest technical developments and can therefore bring the freshest and latest developments in the software world – he continuously learns and evolves. I had a great time working with him."
