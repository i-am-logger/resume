# My awesome jsonresume

My awesome resume is built on [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/)
but instead of building it with json, I've chosen to use
[nix](https://nixos.org) with this project
[jsonresume-nix](https://github.com/TaserudConsulting/jsonresume-nix)
by [Taserud Consulting](https://taserud.net).
